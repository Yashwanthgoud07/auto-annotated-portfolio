description: ' This study compares machine learning algorithms for predicting crime hotspots using historical public property crime data from 2015 to 2018 in a coastal city in China. The LSTM model outperformed others like KNN and random forest. Incorporating built environment data improved predictions, emphasizing the need for both historical data and relevant covariates.'
